# Product Context: DealDone

## Why DealDone Exists

### The Problem Space
M&A professionals receive hundreds of documents during deal evaluation - financial statements, legal contracts, CIMs, pitch decks, and more. Currently, they:
- Manually sort documents into folders
- Spend hours extracting key data points
- Re-enter information into analysis templates
- Risk missing critical details in document review
- Struggle to maintain consistency across deals

### User Pain Points
1. **Time Waste**: 4-6 hours per deal on document organization alone
2. **Manual Data Entry**: Copying numbers from PDFs to Excel models
3. **Version Control**: Tracking which documents contain the latest information
4. **Knowledge Loss**: Insights from one deal don't improve the next
5. **Context Switching**: Jumping between documents to answer questions

## How DealDone Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Installation**: User downloads DealDone, which creates organized folder structure
2. **Template Setup**: User adds their Excel models and templates to Templates folder
3. **Document Drop**: User drags deal documents into DealDone folder
4. **Automatic Processing**: System categorizes docs and extracts data
5. **Review & Refine**: User reviews populated templates, makes corrections
6. **Continuous Use**: System learns from corrections, improving over time

### Core User Experience Principles
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Works like existing folder systems
- **Non-Intrusive**: Enhances workflow without changing it
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Shows confidence levels and data sources
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work immediately, advanced features discovered over time

### Key Interactions
1. **Drag & Drop**: Primary method for adding documents
2. **Double-Click**: Opens documents or analysis files in default applications
3. **Right-Click**: Context menu for document-specific actions
4. **Chat Interface**: Natural language queries about documents
