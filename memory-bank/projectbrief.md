# Project Brief: DealDone

## Project Overview
DealDone is a desktop application designed to streamline M&A deal document management and analysis through AI-powered automation.

## Core Problem
Deal professionals waste significant time manually sorting, organizing, and analyzing documents received from sellers and brokers during M&A transactions. This tedious process delays initial deal assessments and introduces human error in data extraction.

## Solution
An intelligent desktop application that:
- Automatically organizes deal documents into appropriate categories
- Extracts key data using AI and populates analysis templates
- Learns from user corrections to improve accuracy over time
- Provides a conversational interface for document queries and industry research

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated Document Organization**: Drag-and-drop documents get sorted into legal, financial, and general categories
2. **Template Population**: AI extracts data from documents and fills pre-defined analysis templates
3. **Confidence Tracking**: System displays confidence levels for extracted data
4. **Continuous Learning**: User corrections improve future extractions
5. **AI Chat Interface**: Query documents and request industry insights

## Technology Stack
- **Desktop Framework**: Wails (Go + React/TypeScript)
- **AI Processing**: n8n workflows with Claude/Anthropic API
- **Local Storage**: File system-based document management
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## Success Criteria
- 80% reduction in initial deal analysis time
- 95% accuracy in document categorization
- Seamless integration into existing deal workflows
- Positive user feedback on AI assistance quality

## Project Scope
- Phase 1: Core document management and automated analysis
- Phase 2: Enhanced AI capabilities and learning system
- Phase 3: Advanced reporting and collaboration features
