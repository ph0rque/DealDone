# Active Context

## Current Task
Completed Task 2.0 - Document Processing Pipeline
Ready for Task 3.0 - AI Integration Layer

## Recent Implementation

### Document Processing Components
1. **DocumentProcessor** (`documentprocessor.go`)
   - Document type detection with AI/ML interface
   - Rule-based classification fallback
   - Support for multiple file formats
   - Metadata extraction
   - Batch processing capabilities

2. **OCR Service** (`ocrservice.go`)
   - Framework for OCR integration
   - Support for image and PDF processing
   - Multi-language support structure
   - Batch OCR processing
   - Table extraction capabilities

3. **Document Router** (`documentrouter.go`)
   - Intelligent document routing to deal folders
   - Automatic deal folder creation
   - Classification-based routing (legal/financial/general)
   - Batch routing support
   - Move vs copy operations
   - Processing statistics

### Backend Integration
- Updated `app.go` with all new services
- Exposed methods for frontend:
  - ProcessDocument/ProcessDocuments
  - AnalyzeDocument
  - ExtractTextFromDocument
  - GetDocumentMetadata
  - GetDealsList/CreateDeal
  - GetSupportedFileTypes

## Next Focus: AI Integration Layer (Task 3.0)

### Required Components
1. **AI Service Interface**
   - Abstract interface for multiple providers
   - Provider-agnostic API

2. **OpenAI Integration**
   - GPT-4 for document analysis
   - Custom prompts for M&A context
   - Structured response parsing

3. **Claude Integration**
   - Alternative AI provider
   - Fallback capabilities
   - Provider comparison

4. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Document type classification prompts
   - Financial data extraction prompts
   - Risk assessment prompts
   - Deal insights prompts

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Rate limiting
   - Response caching
   - Error handling and retries
   - API key management

## Technical Decisions
- AI service as pluggable interface
- Environment-based configuration for API keys
- Structured prompt templates
- JSON response format for parsing
- Local caching to reduce API calls

## Integration Points
- DocumentProcessor will use AI for classification
- Analysis engine will use AI for insights
- Template population will use AI for data extraction
- UI will show AI confidence scores

## Challenges to Address
- API rate limits
- Cost management
- Response consistency
- Fallback strategies
- Security of API keys

## Current Focus
Just completed Task 1.0 (Folder Structure and Initial Setup) for the automated document analysis feature (PRD 1.0). The application now has:
- A configuration system that handles OS-specific paths
- Folder structure creation for DealDone workspace
- First-run setup flow that guides users
- Template validation and management
- Permission checking for security
- Default templates for common M&A use cases

Ready to begin Task 2.0: Document Processing Pipeline

## Recent Changes
### Task 1.0 Implementation (Completed)
- Created `config.go` for managing application settings
- Built `foldermanager.go` for folder structure operations  
- Implemented `permissions.go` for comprehensive permission checking
- Added `templatemanager.go` for template discovery and validation
- Created `defaulttemplates.go` to generate starter templates
- Built `FirstRunSetup.tsx` React component for initial setup
- Added full test coverage for all new components

## Next Steps
### Task 2.0: Document Processing Pipeline
Need to implement:
1. Document type detection using AI/ML
2. OCR integration for scanned documents
3. Classification logic (legal/financial/general)
4. Document routing to appropriate folders
5. Drag-and-drop file handling
6. Batch processing support
7. Metadata extraction
8. Error handling for unsupported files

## Key Decisions
- Configuration stored in OS-appropriate locations (Application Support on macOS, AppData on Windows)
- Default DealDone folder on Desktop, but user configurable
- Templates folder supports .xlsx, .xls, .docx, .pptx formats
- Deal folders have standard structure: legal/, financial/, general/, analysis/
- First-run setup is mandatory to ensure proper initialization
- Default templates provide immediate value (Financial Model, Due Diligence Checklist, Deal Summary)

## Technical Notes
- Using Wails for desktop app framework
- React/TypeScript for frontend
- Go for backend services
- CSV generation for Excel-compatible templates
- Comprehensive permission checking prevents issues with system directories
- All components have full test coverage

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript (already in place)
- **State Management**: Context API for file manager state
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Go with Wails framework for desktop integration

### Implementation Priorities
1. Document categorization engine
2. Template mapping system
3. AI integration for data extraction
4. Confidence scoring visualization
5. Learning system for corrections

## Open Questions
- How to handle OCR for scanned documents?
- Best approach for template field mapping?
- Optimal confidence threshold for auto-population?
- Version control strategy for analysis files?

## Context for Next Session
When returning to this project:
- Start by reviewing the PRD in `/tasks/prd-automated-document-analysis.md`
- Check task list progress (once generated)
- Focus on implementing document categorization first
- Ensure file system operations are atomic and safe
