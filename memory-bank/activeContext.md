- **Fallback Strategy**: Primary → Secondary → Default provider chain
- **Caching**: SHA256-based keys with LRU eviction
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm

### Configuration
- **Storage**: JSON files in OS-appropriate config directories
- **Security**: API keys never exposed in exports
- **Flexibility**: Runtime configuration changes

## Key Components

### Core AI Files
- `aiservice.go` - Main AI service orchestrator
- `aiprovider_openai.go` - OpenAI provider implementation
- `aiprovider_claude.go` - Claude AI provider implementation
- `aiprovider_default.go` - Rule-based fallback provider
- `aiconfig.go` - Configuration management
- `aicache.go` - Response caching system
- `ratelimiter.go` - Rate limiting implementation

### Integration Points
- `app.go` - Exposes AI methods to frontend
- `documentprocessor.go` - Uses AI for document classification
- Wails bindings regenerated for frontend access

## Current Challenges

1. **API Key Management**: Currently requires environment variables or manual configuration
2. **Large Documents**: Content truncated at 10k characters for AI processing
3. **UI Integration**: No frontend components yet for AI configuration
4. **OCR Integration**: Provider not yet implemented (interface ready)

## Testing Status

All AI components have comprehensive test coverage:
- Cache functionality ✓
- Rate limiting ✓
- Provider fallback ✓
- Configuration management ✓
- Document processing integration ✓

## Architecture Insights

The AI layer is designed for extensibility:
- New providers can be added by implementing `AIServiceInterface`
- Analysis methods are standardized across providers
- Caching and rate limiting are provider-agnostic
- Configuration supports multiple providers simultaneously

The system maintains functionality even without AI:
- Default provider ensures basic document classification
- Rule-based analysis provides fallback insights
- No hard dependency on external services

- Folder structure creation for DealDone workspace
- First-run setup flow that guides users
- Template validation and management
- Permission checking for security
- Default templates for common M&A use cases

Ready to begin Task 2.0: Document Processing Pipeline

## Recent Changes
### Task 1.0 Implementation (Completed)
- Created `config.go` for managing application settings
- Built `foldermanager.go` for folder structure operations  
- Implemented `permissions.go` for comprehensive permission checking
- Added `templatemanager.go` for template discovery and validation
- Created `defaulttemplates.go` to generate starter templates
- Built `FirstRunSetup.tsx` React component for initial setup
- Added full test coverage for all new components

## Next Steps
### Task 2.0: Document Processing Pipeline
Need to implement:
1. Document type detection using AI/ML
2. OCR integration for scanned documents
3. Classification logic (legal/financial/general)
4. Document routing to appropriate folders
5. Drag-and-drop file handling

- Default DealDone folder on Desktop, but user configurable
- Templates folder supports .xlsx, .xls, .docx, .pptx formats
- Deal folders have standard structure: legal/, financial/, general/, analysis/
- First-run setup is mandatory to ensure proper initialization
- Default templates provide immediate value (Financial Model, Due Diligence Checklist, Deal Summary)

## Technical Notes
- Using Wails for desktop app framework
- React/TypeScript for frontend
- Go for backend services
- CSV generation for Excel-compatible templates
- Comprehensive permission checking prevents issues with system directories
- All components have full test coverage

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript (already in place)

- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Go with Wails framework for desktop integration

### Implementation Priorities
1. Document categorization engine
2. Template mapping system
3. AI integration for data extraction
4. Confidence scoring visualization
5. Learning system for corrections

## Open Questions
