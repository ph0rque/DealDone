# Active Context: DealDone

## Current Focus
Creating the core automated document analysis and management feature PRD.

## Recent Activities
1. **PRD Creation**: Generated comprehensive PRD for automated document analysis feature
   - File: `/tasks/prd-automated-document-analysis.md`
   - Status: Complete
   - Next: Generate task breakdown for implementation

2. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up project memory structure
   - Creating core documentation files
   - Establishing project context and patterns

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript (already in place)
- **State Management**: Context API for file manager state
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Go with Wails framework for desktop integration

### Implementation Priorities
1. Document categorization engine
2. Template mapping system
3. AI integration for data extraction
4. Confidence scoring visualization
5. Learning system for corrections

## Next Steps
1. Generate detailed task list from PRD
2. Review existing codebase structure
3. Identify integration points for new features
4. Plan n8n workflow architecture
5. Design API contracts between desktop app and AI services

## Open Questions
- How to handle OCR for scanned documents?
- Best approach for template field mapping?
- Optimal confidence threshold for auto-population?
- Version control strategy for analysis files?

## Context for Next Session
When returning to this project:
- Start by reviewing the PRD in `/tasks/prd-automated-document-analysis.md`
- Check task list progress (once generated)
- Focus on implementing document categorization first
- Ensure file system operations are atomic and safe
