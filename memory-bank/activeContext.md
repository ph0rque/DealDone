## Next Phase: Queue Management and State Tracking ‚è≠Ô∏è

With the n8n workflow development phase complete, we're ready to move to **Task 3.0: Queue Management and State Tracking System**. This phase will implement:

### **Task 3.1-3.8 Overview:**
1. **Queue Manager Service** - FIFO processing with job metadata tracking
2. **Deal Folder Structure Mirroring** - Synchronized state between DealDone and n8n
3. **Queue Persistence** - Surviving application restarts
4. **Race Condition Prevention** - Safe simultaneous file uploads
5. **Queue Status Queries** - Real-time progress tracking for UI
6. **State Synchronization** - Consistent file system and workflow state
7. **Processing History** - Complete audit trail for documents and templates
8. **Comprehensive Testing** - Queue operations and state consistency validation

## Current Challenges for Phase 3
1. **Queue persistence design** - Efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
2. **State synchronization** - Real-time consistency between systems
3. **Concurrency handling** - Thread-safe queue operations
4. **Performance optimization** - High-throughput queue processing
