# Build Status Report

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS - IMPROVING

### Summary
The backend refactoring (PRD-2.0) is making steady progress. We've successfully reorganized the codebase into a clean architecture and have reduced build errors from hundreds to 63. The new package structure is in place and most import issues have been resolved.

### Progress Overview

#### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Foundation Setup (Task 1.0)**
   - Created complete directory structure under `internal/`
   - Created `cmd/dealdone/main.go` as new entry point
   - Added doc.go files for all packages
   - Created shared types and logger interface

2. **Core Business Logic (Task 2.0)**
   - **Templates Package**: Moved 12 template files with proper types and service interface
   - **Documents Package**: Moved document processing files with comprehensive types
   - **Deals Package**: Moved folder management with Deal types and service interface

3. **Infrastructure Packages (Task 3.0)**
   - **AI Package**: Moved 8 AI files with complete types and service interface
   - **Webhooks Package**: Moved webhook files with extensive payload types
   - **N8N Package**: Moved integration with workflow types
   - **Storage Package**: Moved file management
   - **OCR Package**: Moved OCR service with result types

4. **Domain Packages (Task 5.0)**
   - **Analysis Package**: Moved analysis files (dealvaluation, competitiveanalysis, etc.)
   - **Queue Package**: Moved queue management
   - **Workflow Package**: Moved workflow recovery and conflict resolution

5. **Import Resolution Progress**
   - Fixed most import issues in moved files
   - Added proper package prefixes to type references
   - Resolved ValidationRule Pattern field issues
   - Fixed DocumentType and time.Duration conversions
   - Updated imports in root files (fieldmatcher, dealvaluation, etc.)

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress

6. **Remaining Build Errors (63 total)**
   - Undefined types in app.go (WebhookServerConfig, etc.)
   - Some files still need to be moved from root
   - Circular dependency issues to resolve
   - Type compatibility issues between packages

### Current Build Status

**Build Errors: 63** (down from initial hundreds)

Major categories of remaining errors:
1. Undefined types in app.go and other root files
2. Import cycle issues between packages
3. Missing type definitions that need to be created or moved
4. Interface compatibility issues

### Issues Resolved

1. **Type Conflicts**:
   - âœ… Removed duplicate DocumentInfo and DocumentType
   - âœ… Fixed ValidationRule Pattern field usage
   - âœ… Fixed ValidationError Value field
   - âœ… Added OCRResult import to types.go

2. **Import Issues**:
   - âœ… Added imports for ai, ocr, documents, templates packages
   - âœ… Fixed type references with proper package prefixes
   - âœ… Updated imports in analysis files

3. **Type Conversions**:
   - âœ… Fixed DocumentType to string conversions
   - âœ… Fixed time.Duration assignments
   - âœ… Fixed package declarations in moved files

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Undefined Types**:
   - Define WebhookServerConfig and related types
   - Move or create missing types from app.go
   - Fix ProcessingPriority constants

2. **Resolve Circular Dependencies**:
   - Refactor ConfigService usage
   - Create interfaces for cross-package dependencies
   - Use dependency injection pattern

3. **Complete File Migration**:
   - Move remaining root files to appropriate packages
   - Update all import paths
   - Ensure tests are updated

4. **Application Layer (Task 4.0)**:
   - Properly structure app.go with new imports
   - Handle frontend embedding correctly
   - Create proper initialization flow

### Technical Debt

1. **Large Files**: app.go has 5,091 lines and needs to be split
2. **Circular Dependencies**: ConfigService creates import cycles
3. **Missing Interfaces**: Need interfaces for cross-package communication
4. **Type Organization**: Some types are scattered and need consolidation

### Metrics

- **Files Migrated**: ~35 out of ~50
- **Packages Created**: 11 (all planned packages)
- **Build Errors**: 63 (reduced from 200+)
- **Import Issues Fixed**: ~80%

### Recommendations

1. Focus on fixing the remaining 63 errors systematically
2. Create missing type definitions in appropriate packages
3. Use interfaces to break circular dependencies
4. Consider creating a `common` package for shared types
5. Keep app.go functional while gradually extracting functionality
