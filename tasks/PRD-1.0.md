# Product Requirements Document: Automated Document Analysis & Management

## Introduction/Overview

The Automated Document Analysis & Management feature is the core functionality of DealDone that eliminates the tedious manual work involved in initial deal analysis. When users receive various documents from sellers or brokers for M&A deals, this feature automatically organizes them into appropriate categories, analyzes their contents using AI, and populates analysis templates with extracted data. Users can refine the analysis, and the system learns from their corrections to improve future accuracy.

## Goals

1. **Reduce initial deal analysis time by 80%** through automated document categorization and data extraction
2. **Eliminate manual document sorting** by automatically organizing files into legal, financial, and general categories
3. **Accelerate financial modeling** by auto-populating templates with extracted data from source documents
4. **Improve analysis accuracy over time** through machine learning from user corrections
5. **Provide a seamless drag-and-drop workflow** that integrates naturally into existing deal processes

## User Stories

1. **As a deal analyst**, I want to drag and drop a folder of mixed documents and have them automatically sorted by type, so that I can quickly find what I need without manual organization.

2. **As a financial analyst**, I want profit and loss statements to be automatically analyzed and have their data populated into my financial models, so that I can focus on analysis rather than data entry.

3. **As a deal manager**, I want to see confidence levels for extracted data, so that I know which numbers need manual verification.

4. **As a senior analyst**, I want the system to learn from my corrections to extracted data, so that future analyses become more accurate for similar document types.

5. **As a deal team member**, I want to add new documents to an existing deal and have them automatically processed and integrated into the analysis, so that I can keep my models up-to-date effortlessly.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Folder Structure Setup**
   - 1.1 The system must create a root folder structure on desktop or user-specified location upon installation
   - 1.2 The structure must include: `DealDone/Templates/` and `DealDone/Deals/`
   - 1.3 Users must be able to copy their own template files into the Templates folder
   - 1.4 Supported template formats must include: .xlsx, .xls, .pptx, .docx

2. **Document Categorization**
   - 2.1 The system must automatically detect document types based on content analysis
   - 2.2 The system must create deal-specific subfolders: `/legal/`, `/financial/`, `/general/`, `/analysis/`
   - 2.3 Legal documents (NDAs, LOIs, purchase agreements) must be sorted into `/legal/`
   - 2.4 Financial documents (P&L statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements) must be sorted into `/financial/`
   - 2.5 General documents (CIMs, teasers, pitch decks) must be sorted into `/general/`
   - 2.6 The system must handle drag-and-drop of individual files or entire folders

3. **Automated Analysis**
   - 3.1 The system must create copies of relevant templates from `/Templates/` in each deal's `/analysis/` folder
   - 3.2 The system must extract key financial data from documents (revenue, EBITDA, margins, etc.)
   - 3.3 The system must populate extracted data into corresponding cells in analysis templates
   - 3.4 Each extracted data point must include a confidence score (0-100%)
   - 3.5 Confidence scores must be visually displayed (e.g., color coding or percentage indicators)

4. **Continuous Document Processing**
   - 4.1 The system must monitor deal folders for new documents
   - 4.2 New documents must be automatically categorized and processed
   - 4.3 Analysis files must be updated with new data without overwriting user modifications
   - 4.4 The system must maintain version history of analysis updates

5. **Learning from Corrections**
   - 5.1 The system must detect when users modify extracted data in analysis files
   - 5.2 User corrections must be captured and sent to the AI learning system
   - 5.3 Future extractions from similar documents must reflect learned patterns
   - 5.4 Confidence scores must improve over time based on correction patterns

6. **AI Interaction Pane**
   - 6.1 Users must be able to query specific documents ("What's the EBITDA in the 2024 P&L?")
   - 6.2 Users must be able to discuss hypothetical scenarios ("How would a 10% revenue increase affect valuation?")
   - 6.3 The AI must have context awareness of all documents in the current deal
   - 6.4 Users must be able to request industry research and trends

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. This feature will NOT perform legal review or provide legal advice on contracts
2. This feature will NOT make investment recommendations or decisions
3. This feature will NOT share data between different deals or users
4. This feature will NOT modify original source documents
5. This feature will NOT support real-time collaborative editing

## Design Considerations

1. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**
   - Large, clearly marked drop zone for initial document upload
   - Visual feedback during document processing (progress bars, status indicators)
   - Clear visual hierarchy showing deal folder structure

2. **Confidence Visualization**
   - Color-coded cells in spreadsheets (green = high confidence, yellow = medium, red = low)
   - Hover tooltips showing exact confidence percentages and source documents
   - Optional confidence threshold settings for alerts

3. **Processing Status**
   - Real-time status panel showing document processing queue
   - Clear indicators for successful categorization vs. documents needing manual review
   - Processing history log for audit trail

## Technical Considerations

1. **Local File System Integration**
   - Must handle Windows, macOS, and Linux file systems
   - File watching service for detecting new documents
   - Atomic file operations to prevent data corruption

2. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - Document type classification using computer vision and NLP
   - OCR capabilities for scanned documents
   - Structured data extraction using LLMs
   - Local caching of AI results for offline access

3. **Template Mapping**
   - Flexible mapping system between document fields and template cells
   - Support for complex Excel formulas and references
   - Preservation of template formatting and macros

## Success Metrics

1. **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in time spent on initial deal document analysis
2. **Accuracy**: 95% accuracy in document categorization within 30 days of use
3. **Adoption**: 90% of users actively using drag-and-drop workflow within first week
4. **Learning Effectiveness**: 50% reduction in user corrections after 10 deals processed
5. **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 8+ for the document analysis feature

## Open Questions

1. How should the system handle ambiguous documents that could fit multiple categories?
2. What's the preferred behavior when template files have naming conflicts?
3. Should there be a manual override option for document categorization?
4. How many versions of analysis files should be retained?
5. What level of detail should be included in the processing audit log?
6. Should the system support custom categories beyond legal/financial/general?
7. How should the system handle password-protected or encrypted documents?
