# Product Requirements Document: Desktop File Manager

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a desktop file manager prototype application built using Wails, React, and shadcn/ui. The app will provide basic file and folder management capabilities with a clean, modern interface that follows system design patterns. This is a prototype focused on core functionality rather than advanced features.

## Goals

1. Create a functional desktop file manager prototype that can perform basic file operations
2. Implement a clean, intuitive tree-view interface using modern web technologies
3. Establish a solid foundation for future feature expansion
4. Demonstrate integration between Wails backend and React frontend for file system operations
5. Support system theme preferences (light/dark mode)

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to navigate through folders using a tree view so that I can easily explore my file system
- As a user, I want to open files and folders so that I can access my content
- As a user, I want to create new files and folders so that I can organize my work
- As a user, I want to copy files and folders so that I can duplicate content as needed
- As a user, I want to move files and folders so that I can reorganize my file structure
- As a user, I want to delete files and folders so that I can remove unwanted content
- As a user, I want to rename files and folders so that I can keep my content properly labeled
- As a user, I want to search for files and folders so that I can quickly find specific content
- As a user, I want the app to follow my system's theme preferences so that it feels integrated with my desktop environment

## Functional Requirements

### Core File Operations
1. The system must allow users to browse the file system using a tree view interface
2. The system must allow users to open files using the system's default application
3. The system must allow users to open folders (expand/collapse in tree view)
4. The system must allow users to create new folders
5. The system must allow users to create new files (empty files)
6. The system must allow users to copy files and folders
7. The system must allow users to move files and folders (cut/paste or drag-and-drop)
8. The system must allow users to delete files and folders
9. The system must allow users to rename files and folders
10. The system must provide a search function to find files and folders by name

### User Interface Requirements
11. The system must display a tree view of the file system hierarchy
12. The system must show file and folder icons to distinguish between different types
13. The system must provide visual feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages)
14. The system must support both light and dark themes based on system preferences
15. The system must be responsive and work well on different screen sizes

### Technical Requirements
16. The system must be built using Wails framework for the desktop application shell
17. The system must use React for the frontend user interface
18. The system must use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design
19. The system must handle file system operations through Wails backend API
20. The system must work on macOS (primary target platform)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- File previews or thumbnail generation
- Advanced file operations (compression, encryption, advanced permissions)
- Network drive support
- File association management
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Recently opened locations or favorites
- Large directory performance optimization
- Multi-tab or multi-pane interfaces
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Advanced search with filters or metadata
- File versioning or backup features
- Accessibility features beyond basic semantic HTML

## Design Considerations

- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent, modern UI design
- Follow macOS design patterns and conventions
- Implement clean, minimal interface with focus on usability
- Use system icons where possible for file types
- Ensure proper contrast and readability in both light and dark modes
- Tree view should have clear visual hierarchy with proper indentation
- Loading states should be implemented for file operations

## Technical Considerations

- Wails backend will handle all file system operations for security and performance
- React frontend will manage UI state and user interactions
- Consider using React context for managing global app state (current directory, selection, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling for file operations (permissions, disk space, etc.)
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- File operations should be asynchronous to prevent UI blocking

## Success Metrics

- User can successfully navigate file system using tree view
- All basic file operations (create, copy, move, delete, rename) work correctly
- Search functionality returns accurate results
- App loads and responds within acceptable time limits
- Theme switching works properly with system preferences
- No critical bugs or crashes during normal usage

## Open Questions

1. What should be the default starting directory when the app launches?
2. Should deleted files go to system trash or be permanently deleted?
3. What file size or count limits should we consider for search functionality?
4. Should there be confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (delete, overwrite)?
5. How should we handle file operation conflicts (e.g., file already exists)?
6. Should the app remember window size and position between sessions?
