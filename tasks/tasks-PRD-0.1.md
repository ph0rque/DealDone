# Task List: Desktop File Manager Implementation

Based on PRD: `prd-desktop-file-manager.md`

## Relevant Files

### Backend (Go/Wails)
- `app.go` - Main application context and file system operations
- `main.go` - Application entry point and Wails configuration
- `filemanager.go` - Core file management operations (create, copy, move, delete, rename, search)
- `types.go` - Go structs for file/folder data structures
- `utils.go` - Utility functions for file operations and error handling

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main React application component
- `frontend/src/components/FileTree.tsx` - Tree view component for file system navigation
- `frontend/src/components/FileTreeNode.tsx` - Individual tree node component
- `frontend/src/components/FileIcon.tsx` - File type icon component
- `frontend/src/components/ContextMenu.tsx` - Right-click context menu for file operations
- `frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx` - Search functionality component
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components (button, input, dialog, etc.)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useFileOperations.ts` - Custom hook for file operations
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` - Custom hook for theme management
- `frontend/src/contexts/FileManagerContext.tsx` - React context for global state management
- `frontend/src/types/file.ts` - TypeScript types for file/folder structures
- `frontend/src/utils/fileUtils.ts` - Frontend utility functions for file operations
- `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` - General utility functions (shadcn/ui requirements)
- `frontend/src/styles/globals.css` - Global styles including theme variables
- `frontend/components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration file
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### Configuration Files
- `wails.json` - Wails project configuration
- `build/appicon.png` - Application icon

### Notes

- The Wails framework automatically generates TypeScript bindings in `frontend/wailsjs/` directory
- Use `wails dev` to run the application in development mode
- Use `wails build` to create production builds
- shadcn/ui components will be installed in `frontend/src/components/ui/`
