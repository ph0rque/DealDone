# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced AI-Driven "Analyze All" via n8n Workflows

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning  
**Dependencies:** PRD 1.1 (n8n Workflow Integration)

## Executive Summary

PRD 1.2 enhances DealDone's "Analyze All" functionality by transitioning from direct Go backend processing to sophisticated n8n workflows with advanced AI capabilities. This evolution addresses current limitations where template analysis produces raw numeric values (e.g., "5000000") instead of properly formatted, contextually meaningful results (e.g., "AquaFlow Corp", "$25,000,000").

The enhanced system leverages n8n's workflow orchestration to coordinate multiple AI providers, implement intelligent field mapping with semantic understanding, and produce professional-grade populated templates ready for immediate use in M&A deal analysis.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing "Analyze All" Process (Direct Go Backend)
```
User Click "Analyze All" → ProcessFolder() → AnalyzeDocumentsAndPopulateTemplates()
    ↓
For each document:
    1. documentProcessor.ProcessDocument() [Basic AI Classification]
    2. DiscoverTemplatesForN8n() [Template Discovery]
    3. ExtractDocumentFields() [Raw Field Extraction]
    4. MapTemplateFields() [Generic Field Mapping]
    5. PopulateTemplateWithData() [Basic Template Population]
    ↓
Result: Templates with raw values like "5000000" instead of "$25,000,000"
```

### Key Issues with Current Implementation
1. **Poor Field Mapping**: Generic placeholders get mapped to wrong data types
2. **No Currency Formatting**: Raw numbers (25000000) instead of formatted currency ($25,000,000)
3. **Missing Entity Extraction**: Company names and deal names not properly extracted
4. **Limited AI Integration**: Basic classification without sophisticated analysis
5. **No Contextual Understanding**: Field mapping based on confidence scores, not semantic meaning

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Replace Direct Backend Processing** with sophisticated n8n workflows for "Analyze All"
2. **Implement Advanced AI Analysis** using multiple AI providers with specialized prompts
3. **Enable Intelligent Field Mapping** with semantic understanding and contextual awareness
4. **Produce Professional Templates** with proper formatting, currency notation, and meaningful data
5. **Maintain User Experience** while dramatically improving output quality

### Success Criteria
- **Template Quality**: 95% of populated templates contain properly formatted, meaningful data
- **Processing Speed**: Complete "Analyze All" analysis within 3-5 minutes for typical deal folders
- **Data Accuracy**: 90%+ accuracy in field mapping and value extraction
- **User Satisfaction**: Zero complaints about raw numeric values or mismatched fields
- **Reliability**: 99%+ successful completion rate for "Analyze All" operations
