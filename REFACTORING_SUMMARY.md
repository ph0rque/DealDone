# Backend Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Work Completed

### Task 1.0 - Foundation Setup ✅
- Created complete directory structure under `internal/`
  - `internal/core/` - templates, documents, deals
  - `internal/infrastructure/` - ai, webhooks, n8n, storage, ocr
  - `internal/domain/` - analysis, queue, workflow
  - `internal/shared/` - config, logger, types, errors, utils
  - `internal/app/` - application layer
- Created `cmd/dealdone/` directory for new entry point
- Added doc.go files documenting each package's purpose
- Created shared types and interfaces

### Task 2.0 - Core Business Logic ✅
Successfully moved and organized:
- **Templates Package** (12 files):
  - defaulttemplates.go, templateanalytics.go, templatediscovery.go
  - templatemanager.go, templateoptimizer.go, templateparser.go
  - templatepopulator.go, and test files
  - Created types.go with template-specific types
  - Created service.go with unified Service interface
  
- **Documents Package** (2 files):
  - documentprocessor.go, documentrouter.go
  - Created comprehensive types.go
  - Created service.go with document operations interface
  
- **Deals Package** (1 file):
  - foldermanager.go
  - Created types.go with Deal, FolderNode types
  - Created service.go with deals management interface

### Task 3.0 - Infrastructure Packages ✅
Successfully moved and organized:
- **AI Package** (8 files):
  - aiconfig.go, aicache.go, aiservice.go
  - aiprovider_*.go files
  - Created comprehensive types.go
  - Created service.go with AI operations interface
  
- **Webhooks Package** (4 files):
  - webhookservice.go, webhookhandlers.go, webhookschemas.go
  - Created extensive types.go with webhook payloads
  
- **N8N Package** (1 file):
  - n8nintegration.go
  - Created types.go with workflow types
  
- **Storage Package** (1 file):
  - filemanager.go
  
- **OCR Package** (2 files):
  - ocrservice.go and tests
  - Created types.go with OCR result types

### Task 4.0 - Application Layer ⚠️ ATTEMPTED
- Copied app.go to internal/app/
- Copied config.go and permissions.go to internal/app/
- Attempted to create dependency injection
- **BLOCKED** by circular dependencies

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Circular Dependencies
The existing codebase has tightly coupled components:
- ConfigService is used by many components
- AIService is referenced by analysis components
- Components reference each other in circular patterns

### 2. Monolithic Files
- `app.go`: 5,085 lines with all application methods
- `types.go`: 766 lines with all type definitions mixed together
- Difficult to split without breaking functionality

### 3. Package Import Issues
- Go doesn't allow importing main package
- Embed directives don't support relative paths outside module
- Type assertions and interfaces create complex dependencies

### 4. Build Complexity
- Moving files breaks existing imports
- Need to update hundreds of import statements
- Test files also need updates

## Files Still in Root Directory
- app.go, main.go, types.go (core application files)
- Analysis files: dealvaluation.go, competitiveanalysis.go, trendanalysis.go, anomalydetection.go
- Domain files: queuemanager.go, conflictresolver.go, workflowrecovery.go
- Utilities: utils.go, permissions.go, config.go
- Various test files

## Recommendations

### 1. Incremental Migration Strategy
Instead of a big-bang refactoring:
1. Keep existing app.go functional
2. Create new interfaces in packages
3. Gradually move functionality behind interfaces
4. Use dependency injection to break circular dependencies

### 2. Type Organization
1. Create domain-specific type files
2. Use interfaces to decouple packages
3. Move shared types to internal/shared/types

### 3. Build Process
1. Maintain working build throughout migration
2. Use type aliases temporarily during transition
3. Update tests incrementally

### 4. Priority Order
1. Fix circular dependencies first
2. Create clean interfaces
3. Move implementation gradually
4. Update tests last

## Next Steps
1. Revert to working state
2. Create interfaces first
3. Use adapter pattern for legacy code
4. Migrate incrementally, one component at a time
